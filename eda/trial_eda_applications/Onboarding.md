# Onboarding Trial

Although we would like to take on everyone interested in our project, at a certain point the size will become unmanagable and unproductive. 
Given the complexity of the problem space we are favouring candidates with more modeling experience and/or lived experience with T1D (personal or immediate familial relation). 

## Trial Period Task

1. Find the template file in `eda/eda_template.ipynb`
2. [Create a fork of our repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and create a **duplicate** (leave the template available for others) and modify the file `eda_template.ipynb` to:
   1. Load the datasets in the `data` directory. 
   2. Create two visualizations that interest you.
   3. Ask a question or two about diabetes or the data sets. 
3. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your updated `eda_template.ipynb` and please remember to rename the template to something that can identify you to the rest of the group, for me it could be `eda_robopsycho.ipynb`.

**A version of the best/insightful/interesting visualizations will be featured in a substack article (with credit attribution) in the future explaining our project and problem space.**
