# Core Member Onboarding 

This is not the finalized file, but you can get started with these tasks.

1. Star the repository! This is going to represent a significant piece of work in your portfolio, more stars draws more attention to what you've worked on.
2. Change your Discord WAT.ai name to something we can all recognize, please!
3. Follow your teammates. Lets help each other out, that's a major reason we're working on this project.
4. Required readings TBD, [PyTorch Design](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)
5. Familiarize yourself with important repos/libraries we will be using for our projects [sktime](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/), [PyTorch Forecasting](https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/), [Optuna](https://optuna.org/), [simglucose](https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose)
6. Join the sktime discord, invite can be found on the top right of the sktime documentation: [skTime Documentation](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/get_started.html)
7. A brief description of your background on the README page. No need to put your full name if you aren't comfortable with that. But it's a good place to draw attention to your professional websites and socials. 
   1. **If you have T1D, it's helpful if you put :syringe: :droplet: beside your name.** so other members know where to go for T1D specific questions and insights.
   2. **If you've lived with someone for a long period of time who has T1D it's helpful if you put üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüç≠ beside your name.** so other members know where the can ask questions about caring for T1Ds.
8. If you are one of our less experienced developers I highly recommend taking this online winter course from MIT [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
